# Crawling
Developed a web crawling dashboard to fetch and display product data such as price, discount, sizes, and availability from multiple e-commerce websites. 
Implemented functionalities to check content status, filter results, and export or manage product listings dynamically. Used PHP with CURL for scraping. 
The system automates data collection and simplifies product management across various online stores.
